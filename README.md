## Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus

This project is reorganization of the source code for the paper 
[A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus](http://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/).

An interested reader may also look at [this darcs repo](http://sneezy.cs.nott.ac.uk/darcs/LambdaPi/).

The goal of this project is to make reading and navigation of the code as simple as possible.
